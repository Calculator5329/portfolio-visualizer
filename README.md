# Portfolio Visualizer
This is a stock portfolio visualizer program I made using stock data from yfinance.

It takes your portfolio of stocks and their respective weights as input, gathers data from yfinance, converts the data into a pandas dataframe,
and shows simulated past performance using matplotlib.

# Example Portfolio
